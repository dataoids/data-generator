# output-folder

Welcome to the 'Output' folder of the Random Data Generator repository! This folder contains the generated data records from the programs in the main repository.

The data is generated in various formats like CSV, JSON, Excel and SQL. Each file is named according to the type of data it contains. For example, 'users.csv' contains the randomized user records, and 'products.json' contains the randomized product records.

All of the data records in this folder are generated with randomized and realistic values, making them suitable for a variety of use cases such as testing, analysis, and visualization.

Please note that the data in this folder is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used for any production purposes, as it is not real data and may contain errors.

If you have any questions or issues with the data in this folder, please refer to the documentation in the main repository or contact the repository maintainer for assistance.
